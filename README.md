# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-show-Appointment
This repository consists of data analysis projects

This project is titled investigate a dataset, where i worked on a dataset containing over 100k medical appointments 
in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment and a number of characteristics 
about the patients who make the appointments. This dataset was messy and dirty so i had to do some cleaning. first i observed the data from excel
Then i began to ask questions like, is age a determinant for some type of illness, is gender a factor, also what gender would show up more for their appointment
which locations have the highest number of people showing up for their project. After cleaning and from my visualizations, i was able to get the locations with 
the highest show up rate, the gender with the highest show up rate, the gender with most cases for specific illnesses.
