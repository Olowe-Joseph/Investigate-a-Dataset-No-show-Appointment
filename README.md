# Investigate-a-Dataset-No-show-Appointment

## Introduction
This project is titled investigate a dataset, where i worked on a dataset containing over 100k medical appointments 
in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment and a number of characteristics 
about the patients who make the appointments.
Then i began to ask questions like, is age a determinant for some type of illness, is gender a factor, also what gender would show up more for their appointment
which locations have the highest number of people showing up for their project. After cleaning and from my visualizations, i was able to get the locations with 
the highest show up rate, the gender with the highest show up rate, the gender with most cases for specific illnesses.

## Summary of Findings

On exploration, i discovered that the The dataset has 110,527 rows and 14 columns with no duplicates, no null values but with little deficits such as columnns being mis-spelt, and wrong data types being used for some of the columns. I proceeded to doing a data cleaning by changing the data types to the correct format, and i also renamed column headings that were spelt wrongly such as the hipertension and hadcap, changing them back to the correct spellings. Also i dont want my column names having iphens as so i changed the No-Show column by using an underscore instead.
After doing all these, I then started asking questions like which gender has the most hypertensive patients, which neighbourhood has the patients with the highest show up rate, which neighbourhood has the highest rate of patients that show up the most, which gender showed up the most for their appointments, which gender has the highest rate of Alcoholism and which neighbourhood has the lowest turn out to their appointments. 

## Key Insights for Presentation
After cleaning and plotting several visualizations, It helped me better in interpreting my findings. I was able to  see that The male gender has the highest rate of alcoholism. The female gender has the highest hypertensive rate, the male gender showed up the most for their appointments, Jardim camburi has the highest show up rate and aeroporto, Ilha Do Boi, Ilha Do Frade, and Ilhas Oceanicas De Trinidade has the lowest turnout in terms of showing up for their appointment.
